# About Me
Hello my name is Yousof, I'm a very young web developer, at the age of 8 I started to pick up HTML and CSS. Later on, in 2023 I learned very decent javascript. Right now, I'm learning NodeJS which is going very nicely. 

# What do I code?
I liked the idea of coding websites where people can play games but at the same time I've developed a great idea for a massive helpful project for all web developers.
